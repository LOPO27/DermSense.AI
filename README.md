# DermSense.AI

# About
• Existing diagnostic methods for skin conditions are often inefficient and lack precision, leading to delayed or misdiagnoses. Current skincare approaches are not personalized, following a one-size-fits-all model. Limited access to dermatological expertise due to geographical barriers, long waiting times, and high costs leaves many without timely expert insights. 

• Additionally, there is a lack of easily understandable educational content about skin conditions. ***DermSense.AI addresses these issues by providing precise and efficient skin condition identification through advanced classification technology, offering accurate and timely diagnoses for users***.
