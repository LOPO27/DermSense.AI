***About***
Existing diagnostic methods for skin conditions are often inefficient and lack precision, leading to delayed or misdiagnoses. Current skincare approaches are not personalized, following a one-size-fits-all model. Limited access to dermatological expertise due to geographical barriers, long waiting times, and high costs leaves many without timely expert insights. Additionally, there is a lack of easily understandable educational content about skin conditions. DermSense.AI addresses these issues by providing precise and efficient skin condition identification through advanced classification technology, offering accurate and timely diagnoses for users.
